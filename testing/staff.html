                    <strong>First things first,</strong> we're not just hackers or hustlers&mdash;we don't have years
                    of experience with computer science, nor do we eat and breathe code. We're a team of people who
                    <strong>love technology and the impact it can bring about</strong>, whether this comes in the form
                    of competitive programming, regular software engineering work, technopreneurship, or understanding
                    the ethics and means on how technology impacts society. We know it's essential to students and want
                    to induce a network of collaboration and innovation in the youth. We want technology in our lives,
                    integrated whenever it's possible to make something positive, and we love <em>creation</em> with it
                    and through it. <br><br>In short, <strong>we're students that üíñ technology in our own ways and
                        care about exposing, impacting, educating, and empowering. </strong></p>
